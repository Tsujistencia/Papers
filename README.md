In my recent work, I developed an interactive visualization system (P3VS) that models each at-bat as a trajectory of pitch zones, enriched with pitch type, velocity, and outcome. By applying clustering techniques to these sequences, the system reveals strategic pitching patterns and supports real-time, outcome-specific analysis. This research was presented at PacificVis 2024 and iV2025, and has been well received in the sports visualization community.
